# TheMovieDB_E2E_Tests_Selenium
Written Selenium tests cover only two features of themoviedb web page: the main search and Discover Movie search.

Playing a little with PageObject pattern.

A lot of time spent to write waits for events instead of sleep/wait with specific timespan. However, ExpectedConditions seem not working fully... Maybe it's fault of not matching properly version of web driver to version of edge.
